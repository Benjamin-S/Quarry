# Quarry MP

This should resolve syncing issues with mining out resources, toggling between resources to blocks, and autohaul on/off toggle.
The file in Assemblies is already compiled to include this if you want to just drop it in.

Needs 0MultiplayerAPI.dll from Assemblies or https://github.com/notfood/RimWorld-Multiplayer-Compatibility to compile if you're going that route.

# Quarry

This mod adds a quarry for collecting rocks and resources in flat terrain.
